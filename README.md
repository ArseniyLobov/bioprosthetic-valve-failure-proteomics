This repository has three files that are necessary to reproduce statistical analysis of proteomics data from "Proteolytic degradation is the culprit behind a bioprosthetic heart valve failure":

Files list:

R code (code_valves.r)
Results of protein identification - output of Peaks XPro (protein_data.csv)
Sample info in excel format (sample_info.xlsx)
Raw proteomics data will be deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium soon.
